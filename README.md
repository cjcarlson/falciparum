# Climate change and malaria

This repository contains the R scripts for Carlson, Carleton, Odoulami, and Trisos (2022), "The historical fingerprint and future impact of climate change on childhood malaria in Africa," preprint forthcoming on medRxiv. Primary data on malaria were previously published by Snow et al. (2017) and are available online; climate data are too large to be stored here. While most of the pipeline should be reproducible, some files pass in and out of the repository for storage reasons.

R scripts to execute data analysis and visualization are stored in the Pipeline directory:

```
A - Utility functions
├─ A01 - Utility code for calculations.R
└─ A02 - Utility code for plotting.R

B - Extract climate and prevalence data
└─ B01 - Extract CRU data and temperature
```
